## 🔧 How to Enable Full SMS Reading

The current implementation has a placeholder for SMS reading. To enable it:

**Install SMS library:**
```bash
npm install react-native-android-sms
```

**Update the service** (see `SMS_PAYMENT_SETUP.md` for detailed code)

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Change Animation Speed
In `explore.tsx`, modify:
- QR fade duration: line ~335 (`duration: 300`)
- Success delay: line ~346 (`setTimeout(..., 300)`)
- Auto-complete delay: line ~363 (`setTimeout(..., 2000)`)

### Add More Banks
In `sms-payment-monitor.ts`, add keywords:
```typescript
const debitKeywords = [
  'debited', 'paid', 'sent',
  'your-bank-keyword', // Add here
];
```

### Customize Success Animation
In `explore.tsx` styles:
- `successCircle` - Change size/color
- `successText` - Modify text style

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- ✅ Only reads SMS when payment modal is open
- ✅ Only looks for payment-related messages
- ✅ No data stored or transmitted
- ✅ Monitoring stops when modal closes
- ✅ All processing happens locally

## 📱 Permissions Required

- `READ_SMS` - Read incoming messages
- `RECEIVE_SMS` - Receive new messages

User sees permission prompt on first payment attempt.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**SMS not detected?**
- Grant SMS permissions in Settings
- Check console logs for errors
- Use "Done" button as fallback

**Animation not smooth?**
- Ensure react-native-reanimated is installed
- Check for console warnings

**Want to test animation without SMS?**
- Use the "Done" button to trigger manually
